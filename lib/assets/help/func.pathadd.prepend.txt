Prepend directory to PATH

Usage:
  pathadd.prepend [OPTIONS...] [DIRS...]

Available options:
  --force (flag)
    Force add directories even if they already
    present in the PATH
  -o, --override
    Override directories if they already exist
    in the PATH
  -f, --pathfiles
    Read directories list from a file. Empty
    lines and lines starting with '#' are
    ignored. Non-absolute paths are resolved
    relatively to $PWD. Paths prefixed with
    ':' are resolved relatively to the
    pathfile directory. Example:
      # resolves to $PWD
      path/to/add
      # resolves to pathfile directory
      :path/to/add
  --gen-pathfile (flag)
    Generate pathfile dummy to stdout
